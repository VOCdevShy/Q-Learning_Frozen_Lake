This project has been done with Gymnasium from Farama-Foundation that help you in the AI Reinforcement Learining and the Q-Learning domains.

This project has been made in a studying context so it could have some errors in the code (You have a list in the "Bug List" file in the doc folder).

If you want more information about Q-Learning and the Frozen Lake game, please read the article from medium, he help me a lot to understand what to do in the code: https://medium.com/towards-data-science/q-learning-for-beginners-2837b777741
