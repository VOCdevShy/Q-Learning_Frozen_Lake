# Q-Injection

This project is made to inject different types of Q-Tables in the Q-Table for the Q-Learning Frozen Lake.

### Here's the type of Q-Table you could inject:
- Randomize Q-Table
- Trained Q-Table
- 2 Rewards Q-Table

### **⚠️WARNING!⚠️** 
1. This project doesn't work fully with the area 8x8, 16x16 and could contain bugs.
2. To have a full access to the 2x2 and 4x4 Q-Tables to inject, you need to change the environment in the `main.py` and `QInjection.py` files.

(_The maps are in the_ `maps.md` _file in the_ `Tools` _folder. You only need to copy the map you want and replace it in the code by paste it._)

## Goals
This project have three goals, 
1. Test Q-Table
2. Upgrade them again
3. Do it both train before test after
